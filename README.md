# GAKA Portal 🎓

**GAKA** is a centralized, high-performance academic repository specifically designed for Computer Science students at Mbeya University of Science and Technology (MUST). It serves as a streamlined bridge between students and their learning materials.

## 🚀 Features

- **Live Registry Sync**: Directly integrated with a Google Sheets backend for real-time updates without redeploying code.
- **Free Material Downloads**: Students can download learning materials directly and freely without sign-in prompts or extra steps.
- **Mobile-First UX**: A modern, responsive interface built for the student on the move, featuring high-readability typography and thumb-friendly navigation.
- **Zero Friction Access**: No registration, no login, and no data harvesting. Just immediate access to educational content.
- **Smart Filtering**: Categorize resources by "Lecture Notes" or "Gaka" (Past Papers) with instant search capabilities.
- **One-Tap Sharing**: Integrated WhatsApp sharing functionality to distribute resources to study groups instantly.
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Built with Tailwind CSS, featuring glassmorphism, smooth micro-interactions, and a premium "Lexend" font-driven design.

## ⚠️ The Problem

Academic resources in university environments are frequently:
1.  **Fragmented**: Scattered across various WhatsApp groups,  personal cloud drives.
2.  **Inaccessible**: Hidden behind complex folder structures or requiring institutional logins that fail during high-traffic periods (like exam seasons).
3.  **Heavy**: Many student portals are slow, data-heavy, and poorly optimized for mobile devices with limited connectivity.

## ✅ The Solution: GAKA

GAKA solves these bottlenecks by providing a **Lightweight Single Source of Truth**:

- **Optimization**: The portal is a Single Page Application (SPA) that loads only the necessary metadata, saving student data and battery life.
- **Availability**: By leveraging Google's global infrastructure for file hosting and CSV data, the portal remains online even when internal university systems are under maintenance.
- **Simplicity**: It reduces the path from "Searching for a paper" to "Downloading the file" from several minutes to just seconds.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (PostCSS)
- **Data Architecture**: Google Sheets CSV API
- **Icons**: Custom SVG Component Library
- **Typography**: Google Fonts (Lexend)
- **Deployment**: Vite-optimized production build

## 👨‍💻 Development
